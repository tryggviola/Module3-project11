# Module3 / Project11 / Javascript In The Browser - Forms

## Project Brief

Create a form that uses JavaScript to validate and display errors if necessary

## The Goal

<li>Understand the importance of validating forms</li>
<li>Be able to create a form that gets processed by Javascript when submitted</li>
<li>Be able to create proper validation for forms and display the errors to the userB</li>

## Intro

I used the design that we did in the last project (https://www.figma.com/file/h5jmwYXE3aCTSmzBTC9lv7/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) and added all the required functions into that design.

## The Process

I already had the design that I created in previous project so I started compiling everything together in <strong>VS Code</strong>. First I created the HTML and then I styled everything, I wish I had more time to style it a little bit better, the site is not as responsive as I would like it to be but I wanted to focus on the JavaScript part of the project. The JavaScript was fairly complicated even though it looks simple. Getting the error message, clearing the error message and putting buttons in states proofed to be a little more complex then I though but in the end it all came together.

## What I liked

I like the function of the site and how everything works together, I like that I was able to do a little animation when you submit the project and seeing how JavaScript is useful not only for the practicle part of the website but also the look. I look forward to learn more!

## The Conclusion

This project was pretty difficult one, it only says that it should take 3-4 hours but I probably spent three times that amount of time. I learned alot by doing it so it is not all in vain so overall I am happy with the project
